# CODSOFT Internship Projects

Welcome to the CODSOFT repository! This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT. I worked on three impactful projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction with Python, and Credit Card Fraud Detection. Each project encompassed a range of tasks such as data analysis, visualization, prediction, preprocessing, and more. Below is a comprehensive overview of each project and the tasks I undertook.

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Description
In this project, the primary objective was to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

### Tasks Undertaken
- Data Analysis: Explored the Titanic dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data by addressing missing values and converting categorical features into numerical representations.
- Data Visualization: Generated visualizations to uncover patterns in passenger demographics, classes, and survival rates.
- Feature Engineering: Introduced new features, such as family size, to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Model Selection: Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
- Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, and trained the chosen models on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized hyperparameters of the top-performing model for enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Description
This project aimed to predict movie ratings based on various features using Python and machine learning techniques.

### Tasks Undertaken
- Data Collection: Assembled movie data, encompassing features like genre, director, cast, and budget.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the dataset, addressing outliers and missing data points.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Created visualizations to understand the distribution of ratings, budgets, and other relevant features.
- Feature Selection: Identified pivotal features influencing movie ratings.
- Model Building: Implemented regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Partitioned the data, trained the models, and evaluated their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Optional: Model Deployment - Deployed the trained model as a simple web application or API for rating predictions.

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Description
This project revolved around detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms.

### Tasks Undertaken
- Data Understanding: Explored the credit card transaction dataset to comprehend its features and distribution.
- Data Preprocessing: Addressed class imbalance, normalized features, and handled potential outliers.
- Data Visualization: Visualized transaction patterns, class distribution, and feature correlations.
- Feature Engineering: Created pertinent features such as transaction frequency and amount to enhance model performance.
- Model Selection: Choose and implemented anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
- Model Training and Tuning: Trained the selected models and fine-tuned parameters for optimal outcomes.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets, including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Model Interpretation: Analyzed feature importance in identifying fraudulent transactions.
