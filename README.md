# CODSOFT Internship Projects

Welcome to the CODSOFT repository! This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT. I worked on three impactful projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction with Python, and Iris Flower Classification. Each project encompassed a range of tasks such as data analysis, visualization, prediction, preprocessing, and more. Below is a comprehensive overview of each project and the tasks I undertook.

## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Description
In this project, the primary objective was to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

### Tasks Undertaken
- Data Analysis: Explored the Titanic dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data by addressing missing values and converting categorical features into numerical representations.
- Data Visualization: Generated visualizations to uncover patterns in passenger demographics, classes, and survival rates.
- Feature Engineering: Introduced new features, such as family size, to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Model Selection: Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
- Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, and trained the chosen models on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized hyperparameters of the top-performing model for enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Description
This project aimed to predict movie ratings based on various features using Python and machine learning techniques.

### Tasks Undertaken
- Data Collection: Assembled movie data, encompassing features like genre, director, cast, and budget.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the dataset, addressing outliers and missing data points.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Created visualizations to understand the distribution of ratings, budgets, and other relevant features.
- Feature Selection: Identified pivotal features influencing movie ratings.
- Model Building: Implemented regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Partitioned the data, training the models, and evaluated their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Optional: Model Deployment - Deployed the trained model as a simple web application or API for rating predictions.

## Project 3: Iris Flower Classification Project

## Description
This project involves the classification of different species of iris flowers using machine learning algorithms, with a specific focus on utilizing Logistic Regression as the primary model.

## Tasks Undertaken
1. **Data Understanding:** Explored the iris dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of its features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled any missing values, normalized features where necessary, and identified potential outliers.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualized the characteristics of the iris flowers, the distribution of different species, and potential relationships between features.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Derived additional features, such as petal area or sepal ratio, to potentially enhance the predictive power of the model.
5. **Model Selection:** Opted for Logistic Regression as the core classification algorithm since it provides an accuracy of 97%.
6. **Model Training and Tuning:** Trained the Logistic Regression model, fine-tuned hyperparameters, and iterated to achieve optimal results.
7. **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the Logistic Regression model's performance using relevant metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC where applicable.
8. **Model Interpretation:** Analyzed the importance of different features within the Logistic Regression model, elucidating their contribution to classifying iris flower species.

## Conclusion
